## Probability and Combinatorics

### Probability Exercises

Given the following probabilities:

$P(A) = 0.7$

$P(B) = 0.5$

$P(B|A) = 0.4$

#### Question 1: $P(A and B)$
    
Assign your answer to the variable `ans1`


#### Question 2: $P(A|B)$
    
Assign your answer to the variable `ans2`

### Probability Theory

#### Question 3: True or false: $P(A or B)$ is always equal to $P(A)$ + $P(B)$


## Card Combinatorics

A standard deck of playing cards consists of 52 cards in each of the four suits of spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs. Each suit contains 13 cards: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King.
    
You have a standard deck of 52 cards and are asked the following questions:

Answer the questions below:

#### Question 4: What is the probability of drawing a King or a Queen?

Assign your answer to the variable `ans4`


#### Question 5: How many possible 5-card combinations can be formed with this deck of 52 cards?

Assign your answer to the variable `ans5`
